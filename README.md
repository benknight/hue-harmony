# HuePie

Use HuePie to set your Philips Hue lights colors based on the color relationships on an artist's color wheel. Inspired by [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com).

## Setting the bridge IP

HuePie will try to automatically detect the bridge on your local network.  If it can't, or if you have more than one bridge, you can manually set the IP address in the settings.  HuePie will reload itself upon saving the bridge IP.

## Demo Mode

If Huepie finds no local bridge, it will allow you to start up in demo mode.
