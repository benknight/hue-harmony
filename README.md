# Harmony for Philips Hue

Use Harmony to set your Philips Hue lights colors based on the color relationships on an artist's color wheel. Inspired by [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com).

## Setting the bridge IP

The app will try to automatically detect the bridge on your local network.  If it can't, or if you have more than one bridge, you can manually set the IP address in the settings.  The app will reload itself upon saving the bridge IP.

## Demo Mode

If the app finds no local bridge, it can be simulated in demo mode.
